# calculator

This is my final project of the Foundations course from The Odin Project. Here, I will demonstrate and give all the best of my ability and knowledge I have accumulated so far.

My plans are to create a functioning calculator from scratch, and customize and make it as nice as possible as I can with my current knowledge and ability.

And of course most importantly, I am looking forward to learn many new things and acquire new skills through this beginner project.
